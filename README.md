![Connectathon_Graphic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d6afce8-7200-45c0-a7ac-02913a0e1ba0)

The FHIRÂ® Connectathon will be jointly co-hosted by The Standards and Interoperability Laboratory, under the University of the Philippines Manila National Institutes of Healthâ€™s National Telehealth Center (UPM SILab) and the [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia](https://www.csiro.au/) in collaboration with The Philippines Department of Health and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). The Connectathon is part of the [Strengthening Standards Capability Project (SSCP)](https://sscp.health), for improved adoption of Digital Health Data Standards and Interoperability for the Southeast Asia and Pacific region co-funded by CSIRO and Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).

The two-day Connectathon aims to foster interoperability across health systems by providing opportunities for healthcare system developers, business owners, and vendors to participate in critical use cases defined as tracks that focus on clinical and business use cases. The connectathon will also provide testing opportunities for FHIRÂ® Implementation Guides (IGs) such as, NHDR FHIRÂ® IG and Philippine Core FHIRÂ® IG using public FHIRÂ® Servers and Terminology.

### Connectathon Track 1: Point of Service Data Submission

This track will demonstrate how a Point of Service (POS) application can submit health data to a central health data repository. For this track simulation of a health data repository is implemented using the HAPI FHIRÂ® Server. The track uses the draft NHDR FHIRÂ® Implementation Guide (IG) defining the required profiles and value sets for core clinical data exchange such as Patient, Encounter, Medication, Observation; <!-- please review and add resources which are ready to use -->

### Track goals

- Use the $validate operation for IG conformance.
- Successfully submit FHIRÂ® resources to a central server.
- Successfully submit FHIRÂ® bundle to a central server.
- Provide feedback to refine the IG and profiles.

### Connectathon Track 2: Search and Retrieval

This track builds on Track 1 by testing RESTful search and retrieval of clinical data submitted by POS applications. Using the same FHIRÂ® server and resource profiles, participants will query the server to retrieve data for specific patients and observations. This supports key workflows like clinical review, analytics, and verification of submitted data.

### Track Goals

- Perform FHIRÂ® search queries using standard parameters.
- Retrieve resources such as Patient and Observation using patient ID and filters.
- Verify content accuracy and completeness.
- Reinforce understanding of FHIRÂ® REST API conventions.
